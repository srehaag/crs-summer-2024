Seevaratnam\\nCounsel for the claimant(s): Ian D. Hamilton\\nCountry: India\\nRPD Number: TB7-25565\\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TB7-25583\\nATIP Number: A-2020-01274\\nATIP Pages: 000089-000099\\nREASONS FOR DECISION\\n[1] The claimants [XXX] and her minor son, [XXX], claim to be citizens of India, and they are claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.1\\n[2] The adult claimant, [XXX], alleges that she fears returning to India due to membership in a particular social group, as a lesbian. The minor claimant, [XXX] fears returning to Indian, as a member of a particular social group \\u2013 family.\\n[3] The mother, [XXX], consented to being the designated representative for her minor son, [XXX], for the purposes of the hearing.\\n[4] The panel has carefully considered the Chairperson\\u2019s Guideline 9: Proceedings Before the Immigration and Refugee Board Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression (SOGIE),2 prior to assessing the merits of this claim.\\n[5] The panel has also carefully considered the Chairperson\\u2019s Guideline 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution prior to assessing the merits of this claim.3\\nALLEGATIONS\\n[6] The principal claimant testified that her mother deceased when she was a year old and her father was busy working in the fields, so she was raised by her father\\u2019s brother and his wife. The claimant testified that she was born with a [XXX], a [XXX]. She explained that she was constantly compared by her aunt to her aunt\\u2019s own children, whom she considered to be beautiful, whereas she would call the claimant \\u201cugly.\\u201d Furthermore, the aunt would treat her as a servant and keep her busy by making her perform manual labour. This lifelong mistreatment and humiliation led the claimant to attempt suicide at the age of 14 by jumping into a well. She felt isolated and ridiculed. The neighbouring farmers discovered the claimant and saved her.\\n[7] The claimant stated that her aunt and uncle sent their children to private schools and she was forced to attend a public school. She befriended a girl named [XXX] ([XXX])4 at school. She stated that [XXX] was in a similar predicament as her and she had a darker complexion. Both the claimant and [XXX] were of the opinion that no man would ever marry them because of their appearances.5 Over time, they formed a good friendship, which led to physical intimacy.\\n[8] In grade 11, her relationship with [XXX] was discovered and the claimant was beaten by her father and aunt and her education was prematurely terminated. They arranged a marriage for her which she adamantly opposed. The claimant stated that she was forcibly married at the age of 19 to [XXX],6 who was nine years older than her. She testified that he was a drug addict and alcoholic, and that he was physically and sexually abusive to her. On one occasion, he was so sexually aggressive with the claimant that she started bleeding. She reported the incident as rape to the police and the Inspector of Police asked her to return to her husband and indicated sex was part of marriage.7\\n[9] The claimant further explained that she did not enjoy any intimacy with her husband, but he tied her to the bed and frequently forced himself upon her. This led to her unwanted pregnancies. She wanted to terminate her second pregnancy, but the medical staff refused to abort the fetus unless her husband accompanied her to the hospital and consented to the procedure.8 He did not consent and so, she gave birth.\\n[10] In [XXX] 2011, her married life of physical and sexual abuse continued and when she continuously attempted to flee her estranged husband\\u2019s grip, he forcibly tied her to the bed with a rope and burnt her with a hot rod on five areas of her body.9 The claimant provided photographs of the injuries she sustained and she still bears the physical and psychological scars to this day.10\\nDETERMINATION\\n[11] The panel finds the claimants to be Convention refugees. The panel\\u2019s reasons are as follows.\\nIDENTITY\\n[12] In Exhibit 1, the claimants have provided copies of their genuine passports issued by the Republic of India which were initially suspected to be fraudulent but later certified to be true copies by an immigration officer on December 24, 2017.11\\n[13] In Exhibit 9, the claimant has provided a copy of the minor claimant\\u2019s birth certificate12 her 519 orientation training record,13 and her school transfer certificate issued by the Government of Tamil Nadu.14\\n[14] In Exhibit 7,15 the principal claimant has provided copies of her membership documents with the 519 Community Centre, a 519 reference letter, photographs of herself with fellow members of the LGBT community, family photos, photos of her scars, and a letter from her brother, [XXX].\\n[15] The panel finds the principal claimant to be a lesbian. The panel further finds both claimants to be nationals of the Republic of India.\\nCREDIBILITY\\n[16] The panel is guided by the leading jurisprudence on the issue of credibility. Maldonado16 stands for the principle that when a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there is reason to doubt their truthfulness.\\n[17] The principal claimant was straightforward when responding to all questions. Her responses were consistent with the notes from the refugee examinations conducted on December 24, 2017, and December 27, 2017.17 Her sworn viva voce testimony was consistent with her Basis of Claim form (BOC)18 and narrative, her personal documents,19 and country condition documents.20\\n[18] Having considered the totality of the evidence, the panel finds the principal claimant to be a credible and trustworthy witness. Accordingly, both claimants have established their subjective fear.\\nWELL-FOUNDED FEAR OF PERSECUTION\\n[19] The panel has sought guidance from reliable and reputable documentary evidence regarding the current plight of homosexual men in India.\\n[20] According to the current United States Department of State\\u2019s (DOS) \\u201c2018 India Human Rights Report\\u201d in the National Documentation Package (NDP):21\\nOn September 6, the Supreme Court decriminalized same-sex relations in a unanimous verdict. Activists welcomed the verdict but stated it was too early to determine how the verdict would translate into social acceptance, including safe and equal opportunities at workspaces and educational institutions.\\nLesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) persons faced physical attacks, rape, and blackmail. LGBTI groups reported they faced widespread societal discrimination and violence, particularly in rural areas\\u2026\\n[21] In paving the way for the future of the LGBT community, the landmark decision of Navtej Singh Johar v. Union of India suggests the following:22\\nIt is this immense task of combatting the prejudicial attitudes which were encoded in Section 377 which has to continue. Nariman J. was cognisant of this challenge and mandated the Union of lndia to give \\u2018wide publicity to the judgment\\u2019 and conduct \\u2018sensitisation and awareness training for government officials and in particular police officials in the light of observations contained in the judgement\\u2019.\\nWhile Nariman J. emphasises the role of the Union government in combating prejudice and stereotypes in accordance with the principles of the judgment, Chandrachud J. issues an important plea to civil society to continue to work to combat prejudices and realise full equality for LGBT persons in line with the mandate of a transformative Constitution.\\n[22] A World Bank report \\u201cestimates homophobia costs India $31 billion (R455bn) a year due to lower educational achievements, loss of labour productivity and the added costs of providing healthcare to LGBT people who are poor, stressed, suicidal or HIV positive.\\u201d23\\n[23] The Guardian published an article in March 2019 titled, \\u201c\\u2018There are few gay people in India\\u2019: stigma lingers despite legal victory,\\u201d24 which states the following:25\\nThe stigma still lingers. \\u201cIn India, it is a case of ethics,\\u201d says Sanjay Paswan, a member of the Bihar state council and former Indian federal minister who opposed the decision to lift the gay ban. \\u201c[Gay] people are suffering from some psychological weakness or problem or trauma. There are very [few] of them in India\\u2026 \\u201c\\nThe article further states that \\u201c[s]ocial acceptance is lagging far behind legal sanctions.\\u201d26\\n[24] Counsel for the claimant acknowledged that decriminalizing and eradicating section 377 was a milestone for the LGBT community, but he pointed out that section 377 was specifically targeted at gay men. Counsel further explained that the police have numerous other laws which they utilize to charge members of the LGBT such as Anti-beggary laws,27 Nuisance laws,28 and the Immoral Trafficking Prevention Act.29\\n[25] A report by the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) titled \\u201cUnnatural Offences: Obstacles to Justice in India Based on Sexual orientation and Gender\\u201d, cites the 2015 Report of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, which has noted:30\\n\\u201cHuman rights mechanisms continues to emphasize links between criminalization and homophobic and transphobic hate crimes, police abuse, torture, family and community violence and stigmatization, as well as the constraints and criminalization puts on the work of human rights defenders\\u201d\\u2026\\n[26] The documentary evidence highlights the reluctance from many segments of society, including politicians and the police within India, to accept same-sex relationships.\\n[27] Accordingly, the panel finds that the claimants are at risk of persecution due to the principal claimant\\u2019s membership in a particular social group, as a lesbian, and the minor claimant\\u2019s membership in a particular social group, as a family member and the son of a lesbian.\\nSTATE PROTECTION\\n[28] There is a presumption that except in situations where the state is in complete breakdown, the state is capable of protecting its citizens. To rebut the presumption of state protection, a claimant must provide clear and convincing evidence of the state\\u2019s inability to protect its citizens.31\\n[29] According to the United Kingdom (UK) Home Office report at item 6.6 of the NDP: \\u201cIf the person\\u2019s fear is of ill treatment/persecution at the hands of the state, they will not be able to avail themselves to the protection of the authorities.\\u201d32\\n[30] The principal claimant testified that she sought police protection when she was raped by her estranged husband and the Inspector of Police asked her to return to him.33 Furthermore, the claimant testified that the police are intolerant towards members of the LGBT community and they have the same biases as the Indian general community. She believes that police protection will not be forthcoming to her as a lesbian and to her minor son, as the child of a lesbian. She further stated that the members of the police force are one of the agents of persecution and they commit violence towards members of the LGBT community. She fears their wrath.\\n[31] According an objective and recent Response to Information Request (RIR) conducted by the Immigration and Refugee Board:34\\nIn a February 2017 report on obstacles to justice for sexual minorities in India, the ICJ states the following:\\nThe attitude and behaviour of the police is one of the biggest barriers to queer persons\\u2019 access to the justice system in India. Several people spoke to the ICJ bout the violence, abuse and harassment they suffered at the hands of the police. Furthermore, in several cases, the police have refused to file complaints submitted by queer persons owing to bias or stereotypes.\\nThe same source adds that\\n[q]ueer people\\u2019s trust in the police is further eroded by the frequency of their negative interactions with police, for instance, when attempting to register complaints regarding violence and other crimes against them at the hands of private individuals. The police\\u2019s refusal to file such complaints has seriously detrimental impact on queer persons\\u2019 access to justice and redress.\\nUS Country Reports 2018 states that \\u201c[s]ome police committed crimes against LGBTI persons and used the threat of arrest to coerce victims not to report the incidents.\\u201d [footnotes omitted]\\n[32] In light of the above, \\u201cthe ICJ is concerned that the police\\u2019s negative attitude towards queer people in India puts them at an increased risk of violence from non-State actors as well.\\u201d35\\n[33] Furthermore, the ICJ finds that \\u201c[d]emands for justice and accountability for police abuses have led to direct forms of reprisal by the police against those denouncing their abuses.\\u201d36\\n[34] In addition, \\u201c[s]everal people also told the ICJ that they believed that a lack of willing and experienced lawyers who were sensitive to issues of gender, sexuality, and queer rights in India hindered the possibility of obtaining justice in courts.\\u201d37\\n[35] Finally, the ICJ report notes that, \\u201cthere are few legal remedies in the law for the violence and discrimination faced by queer persons. This also makes it difficult to approach the court with cases.\\u201d38\\n[36] The NDP39 and the documents submitted by the claimants40 make clear that the state is the agent of persecution and, in these particular circumstances, is clear and convincing evidence that the state is unable or unwilling to protect the claimant.\\n[37] Accordingly, the panel finds that the claimants have met the burden of proof, on a balance of probabilities, and the presumption of state protection has been rebutted.\\n[38] For the above-mentioned reasons, it is evident that state protection would not be forthcoming for the principal claimant due to her sexual orientation and her minor son.\\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE (IFA)\\n[39] The Federal Court of Appeal established a two-part test for assessing an IFA in Rasaratnam and Thirunavukkarasu:\\n(1) As per Rasaratnam, \\u201cthe Board must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities that there is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted in the part of the country to which it finds an IFA exists\\u201d41 and/or the claimant would not be personally subject to a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture in the IFA.\\n(2) Moreover, the conditions in the part of the country considered to be an IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable in all the circumstances including those particular to the claim, for him to seek refuge there.42\\n[40] The claimants bear the burden of proof to demonstrate that they would be persecuted on a Convention ground, or subject personally, on a balance of probabilities, to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in all of India.\\n[41] Regarding internal relocation, the UK Home Office report states that \\u201c[w]here the person\\u2019s fear is of persecution and /or serious harm by the state, they will not be able to relocate to escape that risk.\\u201d43\\n[42] The UK Office further finds that \\u201cIndia is a vast, diverse, multicultural country, Communities vary considerable not only in size, but also in their religious, ethnic, economic and political composition \\u2013 and in the extent of their adherence to traditional social and family values.\\u201d44\\n[43] According to a recent Response to Information Request (RIR) conducted by the Immigration and Refugee Board reports the following:45\\nIndia Spend reports that single women have to \\u201cdepend [on] somebody\\u2019s goodwill \\u2013 in-laws, parents brothers and sisters-in-law\\u201d in order to provide for them and their children \\u2026 [Furthermore,] single women encounter \\u201cserious struggles with basic life issues such as getting a flat on rent or being taken seriously as a start-up entrepreneur or getting a business loan or even getting an abortion.\\u201d [footnotes omitted]\\n[44] The claimant testified that was used as a servant by her aunt and uncle and she was forced to perform menial tasks at home. She further explained that this was an obstacle to completing her homework and she was often punished by her teachers at school. In addition, when her father and aunt discovered her relationship with [XXX], a female school mate, they terminated her education and forced her into a marriage that she vehemently opposed. Thus, given her limited education, her estranged abusive husband, the lack of family support and as a single lesbian mother, the claimant would face a reasonable possibility of persecution from the Indian community and the Indian police, irrespective of where she lived within India. He minor son would also be subjected to ridicule and mistreatment due his relationship to his mother, a lesbian.\\n[45] A recent article in the New Yorker titled, \\u201cIndia\\u2019s Historic Gay- Rights Ruling and the Slow March of Progress\\u201d46 concludes the following:47\\nA country decolonizes itself slowly. The Supreme Court\\u2019s decision on Section 377 snips away one more tether binding India to its colonial past. But the verdict resembles a strong beam of light only because it pierces through the stormy, illiberal weather around it. The other problems besetting India- a hideous right\\u00ad wing Hindu nationalism; unpunished violence against minorities and lower castes; political corruption; arrests of civic activists under trumped-up accusations; yawning disparities of wealth; the spoiling, perishing environment \\u2013 are all homemade. They cannot be blamed on anyone else; that heaviness of responsibility is part of the compact of growing up. For allowing these dysfunctions to flare, and for failing to stamp them out, India will be able to blame no one but herself.\\n[46] Having carefully considered the totality of the evidence, the panel finds that there is a serious risk of persecution throughout the Republic of India. Thus, in the particular circumstances of the claimant, who is a lesbian single mother with a minor son, an internal flight alternative is unavailable.\\nCONCLUSION\\n[47] The panel finds [XXX] and [XXX] to be Convention refugees. They have established that there is a reasonable chance of persecution if they were to return to their country of nationality, India, today.\\n(signed) S.

            "REASONS FOR DECISION\n",
            "[1] [XXX] (the principal claimant), [XXX] (associate claimant), [XXX] (adult claimant) and [XXX] (minor claimant) claim to be a citizen of Nepal and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (“the Act”)[1].\n",
            "ALLEGATIONS\n",
            "[2] The claimants’ allegations are fully set out in their Basis of Claim forms (BOC)[2]. In summary, the principal claimant alleges a fear of persecution in Nepal because of his political membership and active support of the Nepali Congress (NC) party. The associate, adult and minor claimants allege a fear of persecution because of their imputed political opinion as members of the particular social group of family.\n",
            "[3] The principal and associate claimants are spouses. The adult and minor claimants are their children.\n",
            "DETERMINATION\n",
            "[4] I find that the claimants are Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the Act.\n",
            "ANALYSIS\n",
            "Identity\n",
            "[5] The claimants’ personal and national identities as citizens of Nepal have been established on a balance of probabilities by true copies of their passports[3], marriage certificate and Nepali citizenship certificates for the principal and associate claimants, birth certificates for the adult and minor claimants, a relationship certificate for all claimants[4] and oral testimony.\n",
            "Credibility\n",
            "[6] When a claimant swears that certain facts are true, this creates a presumption of truth unless there is valid reason to doubt their veracity.\n",
            "The principal claimant was an active member of the Nepali Congress (NC) party\n",
            "[7] The principal claimant testified that he has been involved with the Nepali Congress (NC) party since 1990.\n",
            "[8] He correctly identified the date when the NC party was founded and accurately described its ideology as embracing nationalism, federalism and socialism. The principal claimant also testified about his political activities in the NC party. He identified the current NC party leader as Sher Bahadur Deuba and said he was politically active since his childhood and was against the previous Panchayat System. He testified that the party leader had been detained for eight years for his political beliefs and was tortured including through electric shock on his tongue which has resulted in a speech impediment. The principal claimant said he was inspired by the party leader and wanted to advocate for democracy in Nepal.\n",
            "[9] The principal claimant testified that he distributed pamphlets door to door in [XXX] 2008 to promote the NC party and also organized public meetings to further disseminate information about the party and its quest for democracy. He testified that he supported a candidate in the [XXX] 2017 election, invited media to speeches and also expressed his political views about the need for peace and prosperity which could be accomplished by electing an NC government and could not be accomplished through a communist regime.\n",
            "[10] I find, on a balance of probabilities that the principal claimant is an active member of the NC party. His testimony was detailed and spontaneous and he provided additional details in a natural manner and without hesitation when asked to elaborate about his responses. In support of his testimony he submitted a membership letter and a letter from the NC party Chief Secretary attesting to his membership and providing details about his political activities which are consistent with the principal claimant’s other evidence[5].\n",
            "The principal claimant was harassed and assaulted by members of the Biplav Maoists\n",
            "[11] I find that the principal claimant was harassed and threatened by Biplav Maoists in late [XXX] 2017. The principal claimant testified that after he expressed his views against the communist regime, in late [XXX] 2017 Biplav Maoist cadres came to his place of business demanding that he stop campaigning for the NC party and asked him to pay a donation of [XXX] rupees as a penalty for his actions. He said he told them he did not have that amount of money but had [XXX] rupees on the premises which he said they accepted. The principal claimant said he reported this incident to the police but was told that this was a political issue and the police could not help him. The principal claimant’s testimony was detailed, without embellishment and materially consistent with his narrative.\n",
            "[12] I find that the principal claimant was harassed by Biplav Maoist supporters and cadres in [XXX] 2018. He testified that he owned farmland in the Nawalparasi district and visited the property as he was planning to launch a farming project. The principal claimant testified that when he arrived he found people occupying the land who informed him that the Biplav Maoists gave the land to them and they refused to leave. The principal claimant said he reported the incident to the local police who told him that this was a political matter. When he returned to Kathmandu, he said he contacted his minister of parliament who directed him to report the occupation of his farmland to the police in Kathmandu and also told him that he would escalate the issue. The principal claimant testified that Biplav Maoist cadres came to his office later in [XXX] 2018 and harassed him about his anti-communist actions and said they believed he was a [XXX] and therefore should be able to pay [XXX] rupees as a donation. The principal claimant said that the told the cadres he needed a week to pay such a [XXX] amount. He said that the police then contacted him to identify two Biplav Maoist cadres who they had arrested based on the principal claimant’s complaint. The principal claimant testified that the cadres who had been arrested were subsequently released. The principal claimant’s testimony was materially consistent with his narrative however there was a minor discrepancy with some of the dates. It was apparent that the principal claimant was nervous and he was able to clarify the discrepancy in a spontaneous and natural manner. Therefore this minor inconsistency did not impugn his credibility. The principal claimant also submitted a police report to corroborate his testimony[6].\n",
            "[13] I find that the principal claimant was kidnapped and assaulted on [XXX] 2018 by Biplav Maoists. The principal claimant testified that on [XXX] 2018 at 6:30 p.m. he was alone in his office as the staff had already gone home. He said that Biplav Maoists cadres came to his office and under threat of gunpoint took him to an isolated house where he was threatened by the group leader. He said he was told that the Biplav Maoists kill those who do not comply with their directions and they demanded [XXX] rupees as a donation. The principal claimant said he was very scared and panicked and was allowed to call his wife to obtain part of the payment for his release. He said his wife was able to gather the money and he signed a document and was released at a different location. The associate claimant testified that she was able to gather [XXX] rupees from relatives and from a recent [XXX] transaction. She testified that she went to the location for the exchange by motorbike and picked up her husband there and took him to the doctor for medical treatment as he was injured. The principal claimant’s testimony was detailed and consistent with his narrative. He provided additional details about the kidnapping and assault in a spontaneous manner and without embellishment. The associate claimant’s testimony was also detailed and she provided additional details in an unhesitating manner. The principal claimant submitted a donation receipt for [XXX] rupees and a medical report regarding injuries he sustained to corroborate his testimony.\n",
            "Subjective fear: Moved to a relative’s house, did not return to business\n",
            "[14] The principal claimant testified that the minor claimant, his youngest daughter said she did not want to attend school. He said she told him she was being followed. The principal claimant testified that the family relocated to a relative’ s home about 25 minutes away because he had heard the Biplav Maoists abduct children to extort donations. He also testified that since the [XXX] assault he did not return to his place of business and closed it down. The claimants also left Nepal on [XXX] 2018.\n",
            "[15] I find that the conduct of the claimants is consistent with subjective fear. The principal claimant closed down his business after the [XXX] 2018 assault and kidnapping and the family relocated on [XXX] 2018 after the minor claimant was followed. The claimants also left Nepal promptly about a week after the kidnapping.\n",
            "Objective Basis\n",
            "[16] The objective evidence is consistent with the claimants’ account of fearing persecution because of their actual and imputed political opinion[7].\n",
            "[17] Item 2.1[8] of the objective documents indicates that while elections were generally well conducted, there were reports of violent incidents including individuals being killed by the police and reports of interparty clashes and assaults. According to item 4.4[9], political incidents were the primary driver of violent incidents and made up the majority of the non-violent incidents. This report also notes activities by the CPN-Chand Maoists to attempt to disrupt the election process.\n",
            "[18] Item 1.6[10] indicates that a diverse array of political parties operate in Nepal although the system has faced considerable instability in recent years. This report also states that political opponents of the Maoists do not generally face violence because Maoists have the potential to control the national agenda without resorting to violence. However this report does not specify whether this applies to the CPN Maoists or Biplav Maoists who are a splinter group from the Nepal Communist Party currently in power.\n",
            "[19] As well, the claimant’s counsel provided numerous articles about the wide reach and violent activities perpetrated by the Biplav Maoists including extortion similar to the kind the principal claimant describes in his BOC[11].\n",
            "[20] I find that the claimants’ fear of persecution because of their actual and imputed political opinion has an objective basis and is well-founded.\n",
            "State Protection\n",
            "[21] A state, unless in a condition of complete breakdown, is presumed to be capable of protecting its citizens. To rebut the presumption of state protection, a claimant must provide clear and convincing evidence of the state’s inability to protect its citizens.\n",
            "[22] The objective documents indicate that historical claims of abuses by the Maoists remain unsolved and there is a prevailing climate of impunity in part because senior government officials have the potential to shield leaders of major political parties from prosecution and investigation. This report further states that police effectiveness is limited by lack of resources, corruption, nepotism and a culture of impunity especially among low level officers[12].\n",
            "[23] Based on the personal circumstances of the claimants as well as the objective country documentation, I find that they have rebutted the presumption of state protection and state protection would not be reasonably available to them in their particular circumstances. The principal claimant sought the assistance of the police on multiple occasions without any reasonable protection being made available to him.\n",
            "Internal Flight Alternative (IFA)\n",
            "[24] The test to be applied in determining whether there is a viable IFA is two-pronged, and both prongs must be satisfied for a finding that a claimant has a viable IFA. First, I must find on a balance of probabilities that there is no serious possibility that the claimants would be persecuted in the part of the country in which I find an IFA exists. Secondly, conditions in the part of the country considered to be an IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable, in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claimants for them to seek refuge there.\n",
            "[25] The objective evidence indicates that the Biplav Maoists (CPN) have a presence in all 77 districts of Nepal and have mobilized across the country. Further there is a nationwide crackdown by the government against this group[13] as well as reports of violence perpetrated by the Biplav Maoists in the IFA locations proposed.\n",
            "[26] Therefore I find there a serious possibility of persecution in the country and there is no IFA available to the claimants in Nepal as the Biplav Maoists are present throughout the country and would be motivated to find them. The evidence demonstrates that the Biplav Maoists sought the claimant in Kathmandu where his primary business was located, followed his younger daughter (minor claimant) and knew about the principal claimant’s activities in Nawalparisi, some distance away from his home.\n",
            "CONCLUSION\n",
            "[27] Having considered all of the evidence, I find that there is a serious possibility that the claimants would face persecution in Nepal. I find that the claimants are Convention refugees and I accept their claims.\n",

From then onwards, you make the decision to hide your true gender identity while planning your departure from Saudi Arabia.\\n[7] It is in this context that you decide to pursue your university studies in the United States (USA). You reach the USA on XXXX XXXX 2018.\\n[8] In that country, while you do make your gender identity public, you do remain cautious as you fear that you might be denounced to Saudi Embassy officials or come across someone who knows you. You also become the target of harassment as well as rape and death threats at the hands of a group of Arab men who attend the same classes as you in university. As this situation becomes increasingly difficult, it not only prevents you from completing your last semester, but causes you to become suicidal and leads you to seek refuge somewhere else.\\n[9] It is in this context that you decide to come to Canada to seek asylum. You are presently pursuing the hormone treatment you started in the USA and are considering converting to the Christian faith.\\nDETERMINATION\\n[10] I find that you are a Convention refugee as you have established a serious possibility of persecution should you return to Saudi Arabia based on the grounds in section 96.\\nANALYSIS\\nIdentity\\n[11] I find that your identity as a national of Saudi Arabia is established by the documents provided, namely your passport.\\nNexus\\n[12] I find that you have established a nexus to section 96 by reason of your membership in a particular social group, namely Saudi transgendered individuals.\\nCredibility\\n[13] Based on the documents in the file, I have noted no serious credibility issues.\\n[14] In particular, the evidence establishes the allegations as set out above. Exhibits E-3 to E- 6 corroborate your allegations with respect to the treatment you faced at the hands of your cousin in Saudi Arabia, and the transition process you have initiated through, inter alia, hormonal therapy. Exhibits E-1 and E-2 corroborate your allegations with respect to your status in the USA. After reviewing the documents, I have no reasons to doubt neither their authenticity, nor the truthfulness of their content.\\n[15] With respect to your failure to claim asylum in the USA, I find the explanations you have provided to justify your actions to be reasonable, in light of your specific circumstances. Therefore, I find that your actions neither display a lack of subjective fear, nor do they undermine your general credibility.\\nObjective basis of future risk\\n[16] Based on the credibility of your allegations, and the documentary evidence set out below, I find that as a transgendered individual, you have established a future risk that you will be subjected to the following harm should you return to Saudi Arabia: official and societal discrimination, harassment, physical violence, possibly of a sexual nature, arbitrary arrest and detention.\\n[17] The fact that you face this risk is corroborated by the documents found at tabs 2.1, 6.1 and 6.3 of the National Documentation Package for Saudi Arabia, in its March 29, 2019 Version.\\nNature of the harm\\n[18] This harm clearly amounts to persecution.\\nState protection\\n[19] Considering that according to the above-cited documentary sources, authorities do not make a distinction between transgendered and intersexed individuals and homosexuals; considering the documented treatment reserved to homosexuals by police authorities, I find that there is clear and convincing evidence before me that the state is unable or unwilling to provide you with adequate protection.\\nInternal flight alternative\\n[20] I have considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for you. On the evidence before me, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Saudi Arabia.\\nCONCLUSION\\n[21] Based on the analysis above, I conclude that you are a Convention refugee. Accordingly, I accept your claim.\\n(signed) Fran\\u00e7ois Ramsay\\nFebruary 21, 2020\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"other\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 19,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"{\\\"country\\\": \\\"Saudi Arabia\\\", \\\"case_type\\\": \\\"PSG: SOGIE\\\", \\\"member\\\": \\\"Fran\\\\u00e7ois Ramsay\\\"}\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"is_trans\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"False\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
